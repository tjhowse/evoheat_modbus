This is not a working interface to evoheat modbus things.

Write the esphome code to an ESP32.

Run test.py to dump the raw bytes from the evoheat controller to files.

Run parse.py to convert the bytes into register values.

I have nothing further to contribute on this topic. I may revisit this project in the future.
